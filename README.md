## Questions & Answers

### What was the most difficult part of this challenge?

Making the data section of the each task to the bottom of each container and making them responsive as well. I did use a solution to make it happen, but it still needs to be optimized/corrected.

### What was the easiest part of this challenge?

This seems to be a tricky question ðŸ˜…. Truly speaking, I never thought this to be hard. But, as I progressed on trying to bring the design to code. It was getting hard for me, atleast some part of it. This always happens to me. Seems like I need to work on my designing skills. I am more of a developer and was an OK designer. For me, this design seems to be normal, but when I tried, I got to know more things.

## ADDITIONAL NOTE

1. I had already coded the design and forgot that I had to push the commits so that it would help in the evaluation. Sorry for that, but I tried to make the commits in such a way that atleast you can understand my approach.
2. I thought of making the light and dark functionality as well, but it seems I ran out of time.
3. Some of the colors were not mentioned in the style-guide.md, the hover states color were not mentioned, but anyway I applied it by inspecting the images/designs.
